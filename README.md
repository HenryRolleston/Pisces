Kia Ora,  
Below is the Executable file for 'Pisces', which is a simple Data Migration program I wrote in my second year of
CompSci. On first execution, it will install the Configuration .txt file, and subsequent executions will use the
information in that file to run. The program is simple, and was written before Object Oriented programming (and other
more advanced programming techniques) were taught to me, but functions quickly and accurately.
